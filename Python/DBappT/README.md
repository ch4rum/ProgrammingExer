## ðŸ‘¾ Feature
**Visual Experience**

$Python$ code provides a command line interface **$(CLI)$** for managing and querying data in a *SQL* database. It allows you to perform **CRUD** operations, execute custom queries and handle close signals securely, providing a simple and efficient user experience.

- Prompting the user for their DB username and password. The password is *base64* encrypted, using a random encryption key, to ensure the security of the access data.

- Present the user with an interactive menu with various options for managing the database. Each option is labeled with a number or letter, allowing easy navigation.

- Allow inserting new records into the database. Each function requests the necessary data and sends it to the database for storage.

- Methods that allow the user to perform queries and generate reports based on the data in the database. In addition, the option to run custom queries though the *different_query* method is included. 

> [!CAUTION]
> The database used is already created in advance. You can [download to here](https://github.com/ch4rum/ProgrammingExer/tree/master/DB/).

Check the [changelog](https://github.com/ch4rum/ProgrammingExer/blob/master/Python/DBappT/CHANGELOG.md) for updates.
